  ## Description
  For this assignment, I had to create an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Employee data was generated with the randomuser.me API.
  
 
  ## Installation
  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  npm install

  ## Usage 
  Clone/fork repo and install the necessary dependencies. Run the server with npm start and view application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


  ## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
